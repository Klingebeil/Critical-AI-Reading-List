# Styleguide for writing about AI (a proposal)

1. **Avoid using AI, use more precise language such as _machine learning_ or _neural nets_.**
2. **Avoid personalizing an AI system.** Even anthropomorphized systems, such as Siri or Cortana, do simply simulate a personality.
3. **Avoid magical thinking.** AI systems have inert limits and won't solve big problems simply by being.
4. **Avoid writing about the automation of "jobs".** Most automation is quite narrow on limited to individual tasks. Jobs will get lost, if most or all tasks itâ€˜s made of get automated.
5. **Look for the balance of power.** Especially machine learning systems are the heir to the Big Data throne. TBA
